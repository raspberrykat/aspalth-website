            How It Works?
            <br>
            Players' scores from races, events, and challenges are automatically uploaded to the global leaderboards. The leaderboards are updated in real-time, so players can track their progress and see how they rank against their friends and other top racers worldwide. There are multiple categories, including overall rankings, weekly rankings, and specific event rankings, ensuring that there are many ways to climb the ranks.
